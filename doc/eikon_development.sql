You always said with digital to blast away and never put your flash down a half stop etc. I totally agree with that, you need as much light as you can!

 ('56','Ray','(206) 866-5933','mrktng.srvs@gmail.com','','Other','0','Dear Head of Business Development at Eikonphotographer.com,\n\nWere you aware that you are paying every time your online marketing advertisement is clicked? It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.\n\nI thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Eikonphotographer.com\n\n1. Your home page rank is 2, this can be improved further.\n\n2. Your SEO score is 87%. This can be improved as implementing on and off-page factors will fetch better results in major search engines.\n\n3. Open directory listing is not available.\n\nIf you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE. I would first need to know that you are serious about using our services, as the report would involve several hours of our research.\n\nTo brief you about the company, we are an ISO 9001 certified team of over 500 SEO specialists in the USA and would like to talk with you about how you should be winning new business from the search engines, without paying advertisers over and over again for it.\n\nSEO is not instantaneous, it is not free, but it is the only sensible internet marketing choice. Your return on investment (ROI) after 6 months of SEO will be at least 3 times that of paid advertisements, and many times greater than our cost. In fact, we guarantee that in the first month of our work you will see an improvement in ranking, link popularity and traffic or we\'ll work for free until you do! Our clients\' consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of Google. Being on the top left of Google (#1- #5 Organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\'s website traffic and online reputation.\n\nIronically, It’s very likely that had you spent your last 6 months of online marketing dollars on SEO instead of paid advertising that you would have 3 times or greater the traffic today and not need the paid advertising at all.\n\nFortunately you can still start today and begin getting that traffic in just a few weeks. We look forward to discussing our SEO plans with you.\n\nSounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide your best time and phone number to call you.\n\nBest Regards,\nRay\nUS:(206) 866-5933\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPS1: This is onetime email and we won’t contact you if you don’t respond to this email.  You may also ask us for “REMOVE”.\nPS2: We found your site from online advertisements but did not click the Ad to visit. \nPS3:  We work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. So we will send more details on “our company profile”, “client references”, “case studies”, “why you should choose us?”, “price list”, “guarantee” etc. upon getting positive response from you.','2010-08-18 07:27:00','2010-08-18 07:27:00'),

 ('166','San','240-207-4922','Seo.toplink@gmail.com','','Other','1','Dear Head of Business Development at Eikonphoto.com,\n\nWere you aware that you are paying every time your online marketing advertisement is clicked? It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.\n\nI thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Eikonphoto.com\n\n1. Your home page rank is 3, this can be improved further.\n\n2. Your title is 88% relevant. This can be improved for higher Google ranking.\n\n3. Your SEO score is 89%. This can be improved as implementing on and off-page factors will fetch better results in major search engines.\n\nIf you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE. I would first need to know that you are serious about using our services, as the report would involve several hours of our research.\n\nTo brief you about the company, we are an ISO 9001 certified team of over 500 SEO specialists in the USA and would like to talk with you about how you should be winning new business from the search engines, without paying advertisers over and over again for it. \n\nSEO is not instantaneous, it is not free, but it is the only sensible internet marketing choice. Your return on investment (ROI) after 6 months of SEO will be at least 3 times that of paid advertisements, and many times greater than our cost. In fact, we guarantee that in the first month of our work you will see an improvement in ranking, link popularity and traffic or we\'ll work for free until you do! Our clients\' consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of Google. Being on the top left of Google (#1- #5 Organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\'s website traffic and online reputation. \n\nIronically, It’s very likely that had you spent your last 6 months of online marketing dollars on SEO instead of paid advertising that you would have 3 times or greater the traffic today and not need the paid advertising at all. \n\nFortunately you can still start today and begin getting that traffic in just a few weeks. We look forward to discussing our SEO plans with you. \n\nSounds interesting? Feel free to email us or alternatively you can provide your best time and phone number to call you.\n\nBest Regards,\nSan\n(240) 207-4922\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPS1: This is onetime email and we won’t contact you if you don’t respond to this email.  You may also ask us for “REMOVE”. \nPS2: We found your site from online advertisements but did not click the Ad to visit. \nPS3:  We work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. So we will send more details on “our company profile”, “client references”, “case studies”, “why you should choose us?”, “price list”, “guarantee” etc. upon getting positive response from you.','2010-09-29 20:34:24','2010-09-29 20:34:24'),

We provide free portraiture for those who serve: the military, first responders, healthcare professionals. \n\nWe are based in Southern California -- serving Camp Pendleton and all of California presently. We work with Snowball Express (snowballexpress.org), the Illumination Foundation, OC Rescue Mission, and other service outreach organizations to provide those who serve with hi-res jpegs which they can print or email to their loved ones.\n\nI was recently approached by a group that works with providing seizure response dogs for military families that have kids who suffer from Lennox Gaustau Syndrome. We are looking for a photographer in the D.C./Virginia area, who would be willing to join our effort and take a few photos of the Sergeant who founded the group in D.C. He and his family live in the area and are hoping to have pro photos which they can use on their website and in collateral.\n\nBeyond that, we have made several significant contacts with the Department of Defense and will be looking to expand our effort and reach, so if you have any interest in considering joining up with our cause, we would love to have you a part of our team -- for both your amazing talent and your strategic logistics!\n\nYou can visit our website to review some of the shoots we\'ve done over the past year.

It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.\n\nI thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Eikonphotographer.com\n\n1. Your home page rank is 2, this can be improved further.\n\n2. Your SEO score is 87%. This can be improved as implementing on and off-page factors will fetch better results in major search engines.\n\n3. Open directory listing is not available.\n\nIf you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs, and are curious to know what our working together would involve, then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE. I would first need to know that you are serious about using our services, as the report would involve several hours of our research.\n\nTo brief you about the company, we are a SEO Company with a worldwide customer base. A team of over 700 SEO specialists in USA and India is serving a vast portfolio of clients who have transformed their businesses by just opting for our services. Thus we would like to talk with you about how you should be winning new business from the search engines, without paying advertisers over and over again for it.\n\nSEO is not instantaneous, it is not free, but it is the only sensible internet marketing choice. Your return on investment (ROI) after 6 months of SEO will be at least 3 times that of paid advertisements, and many times greater than our cost. In fact, we guarantee that in the first month of our work you will see an improvement in ranking, link popularity and traffic or we\'ll work for free until you do! Our clients\' consistently tell us that their customers find them because they are at the top of Google. Being on the top left of Google (#1- #5 Organic positions) is the best thing you can do for your company\'s website traffic and online reputation.\n\nIronically, it\'s very likely that had you spent your last 6 months of online marketing in dollars on SEO instead of paid advertising that you would have 3 times or greater traffic than today  and not need the paid advertising at all.\n\nFortunately, you can still start today and begin getting that traffic in just a few weeks. We look forward to discuss our SEO plans with you.\n\nSounds interesting?

It hurts! I know, as many of our clients have shared this frustration when I first talked to them about how to drive more quality prospects to their sites - without having to constantly pay for every click.\n\nI thought you might like to know some of the reasons why you are not getting more organic (FREE) search engine traffic for Eikonphoto.com\n\n1. Your home page rank is 3, this can be improved further.\n\n2. Your title is 88% relevant. This can be improved for higher Google ranking.\n\n3. Your SEO score is 89%. This can be improved as implementing on and off-page factors will fetch better results in major search engines.\n\nIf you can stomach more bad news about what your site needs and are curious to know what our working together would involve then I would be glad to provide you with further detailed analysis in the form of a SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) SITE REPORT - FREE OF CHARGE.

I am interested in using your services for my daughters Bat Mitzvah. I like your work as far as what I saw on line. It seems you are creative with a bit more \"flavor\" than some of the Bat Mitzvah photographers I have seen. To give you some background,  the ceremony would be at the Sixth and I Street Historic Temple starting at 10 am so I assume we should be there a few hrs or so prior for some pics, and then the party is from 12:30 pm to 4:30 pm at a hotel downtown immediately afterwards. I am guessing we would need you maybe 6 hrs, not sure (from 8-10 am then from 12:30 to 4:30 pm). I know we want (1) albulm and surely grandparents may order ones of their own, and pics we can view on line so other guests from out of town can choose what they like. I know we will want some traditional still photos of family memeber dressed up that day but was hoping to add in some black and whites, interesting angles, super imposed or maybe the \"andy warhol\" sort of look photos mixed. I am not sure what options are out there and would like your suggestions of what we could do different. Pls call or e-mail me with your availability and pricing and perhaps we can meet soon. pls let meknwo asap if you are available on the date because time is of the essence.\n\nThank you,\n\nMia Jeffries','2011-01-13 14:08:44','2011-01-13 14:08:44'),

It is not necessary to be nude or revealing in female boudoir pictures. It has more to do with an attitude or state of mind than the state of dress or undress. The primary ideas conveyed in female boudoir portrait are love, affection, romance, and giving. Female Boudoir Photography is almost always done in the studio.Lawrence uses subtle lighting, sensual  poses, and a comfortable  studio atmosphere to help put you at ease and to bring out that sexy you. Female boudoir photos are the perfect gift for your significant other, boyfriend, girlfriend, lover, or the groom on your wedding day. Boudoir photography brings out the natural beauty all women possess. You can order  portfolio albums,  calendars, and wall portraits as a gift for a birthday, your anniversary, Sweetest Day, Valentine\'s Day, Christmas, Father\'s Day, or just as a romantic surprise.\r\nGlamour  Photography is a term commonly used to describe a flattering type of photograph usually taken of one person. Glamour means SEXY - posing in a sexy manner or wearing low-cut or transparent blouses, short skirts, open shorts and/or shirts, or some topless.  Glamour Photography can also be suggestive but non-revealing.\r\nA Glamour Photographic Session takes approximately one to three hours to complete. The challenge in Glamour Photography is to employ minimal garments effectively to create a visually pleasing, thematically intriguing image. In simple terms, Glamour Photography is all about the model, not her clothes. Less clothing means MORE model.Lawrence uses his resources and creativity to create a  classy and romantic piece of art that ignites confidence and excitement in a  bride or wife, re-enforces beauty in a woman, and romance in a couple.\r\nWe specialize in photographing the essence and beauty of  every woman. Our clients are diverse and range from mothers to soon to be  brides. Our goal is to celebrate each woman individually, capturing her in a  new light that can re-ignite confidence and the way she sees herself.\r\nWe provide boudoir and glamour photography in the *washington dc area*.

 ('2','<h3>Portraiture</h3>\n          <p class=\'top\'>I specialize in fine art black and white and color lifestyle portrait photography. My subjects can be any age but pre dominantly maternity, newborns, infants, babies, children. Maternity and newborn portraiture was a natural extension of my work and grew from a demand from many brides and their friends to create artistic images that would become a loved and cherished heirloom instead of the mall or school pictures, which are often a display of torture rather than the essence of a small Childs spirit. When I visit client&rsquo;s homes I love to see family history and stories displayed on their walls. Why not fill your walls with the Art of Childhood? These fleeting moments will NEVER come again.</p>\n\n          <h4>Maternity Portraits</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>Also known as Pregnancy Portraits or Mother-to-Be Portraits, the maternity portrait session is designed to capture the wonder and beauty of the female form during the last months of pregnancy. I recommend that we schedule the Maternity portraits for some time after the 33rd week. Depending on how you feel while pregnant, you may want to wait until you are 35 or 36 weeks along to really show off those curves!</p>\n\n          <h4>Newborn Portraits</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>The perfect time for a newborn session is during the first two weeks of life. It is important to capture all the newness of your infant. They have tiny, clenched hands and newborn curl. During your newborn portrait session, time is allotted for breaks, keeping a relaxed mood for everyone concerned. These sessions can be located either at my studio or at your home.</p>\n\n          <h4>Infant Portrait</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>Once your child reaches three months old, it is time to schedule an infant portrait session. No longer a sleepy newborn, your baby is now alert and participating in his world. Documenting your child&#x27;s first year of life with several portrait sessions will ensure that you don&#x27;t miss any of the amazing changes they will go through. I also recommend a portrait session at the time when baby is able to sit up. I find they are very engaged with their world at this stage.</p>\n\n          <h4>Children&#x27;s Portrait</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>These portrait sessions capture the splendor and magic of childhood. Allowing your child to play and explore their surroundings, these sessions are designed for your child to have a great time, which in turn, results in great portraits.</p>\n        ','Portraiture','2','2013-03-07 07:57:37','2013-03-07 07:57:37'),
 ('3','<h3>Wedding Photography</h3>\n          <p class=\'top\'>I creatively document weddings and capture life through modern portraiture. My style is documentary photojournalistic, is unobtrusive and non-invasive. It&#x27;s &lsquo;non-posed&rsquo;, unexpected, and with an original twist. I have a relaxed working style that captures both formal and candid moments This is documentary wedding photography as it happens which means capturing the funny, the artistic, the glamorous, the family memories, the details, and indeed any group and family pictures that you want. As a wedding is a one-time event, the photographer must be able to anticipate the action yet be prepared for the unexpected. Shooting a wedding is both exhausting and invigorating as I am always in search of original angles while still maintaining a &lsquo;fly on the wall&rsquo; approach. An ability to tactfully take charge also helps - particularly when photographing large groups or families. I&#x27;ve photographed clients of every religion, nationality, and sexual orientation and open-minded approach to wedding photojournalism makes me approachable and honest.</p>\n\n          <h4>Weddings and cost.</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>First and foremost, I understand the value of the investment you&#x27;ll make in your wedding photography. It&rsquo;s a financial investment, but just as importantly it&#x27;s an investment of your trust in my expertise and 18 years of professional experience. Memories, decisive moments - photographs I create that transcend the event, become images of great sentimental and artistic value. My goal is to bring you these qualities within a pricing structure that is simple and flexible and a working relationship with my clients that is fun and relaxed. My pricing structure allows you to create an individual collection of services based on the number of hours of coverage that suit your event. You can select the services that work for you. A cornerstone of my pricing is the inclusion of the high resolution files burned to DVD. I can&#x27;t overstate what a HUGE value this represents financially and more importantly in terms of having those images for future generations. Each image is edited, color corrected and complete with a black and white version (as well as the color version). I give you reproduction rights, which means that you can print whatever you want for your personal use. It&#x27;s all entirely up to you! This flexibility means that you can create your own albums, or I can provide you with expertly designed albums from some of the top album manufacturers. I am available for engagements, rehearsals and gown fittings, but as before - it&#x27;s your call, your wedding and your budget. Other things you may want to know. I use an in house gallery system for on line viewing and have a team of assistants who work with me. Discounts are available for winter weddings and Friday and Sunday weddings.</p>\n\n          <h4>What sites have you photographed in?</h4>\n          <p class=\'top\'>If it&rsquo;s within a 100 miles of Washington DC, I&rsquo;ve probably photographed an event there.</p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>NMWA (National Museum for Women in the Arts)</li>\n            <li>Willard Hotel</li>\n            <li>Ronald Reagan Building</li>\n            <li>Sofitel</li>\n            <li>National Building Museum</li>\n            <li>University Club of Washington DC</li>\n            <li>Kennedy Center for he Performing Arts</li>\n            <li>The Hay Adams</li>\n            <li>Ritz Carlton Georgetown</li>\n            <li>The Watergate Hotel</li>\n          </ul>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Algonkian Regional Park, Sterling</li>\n            <li>Alwyngton Manor, Warrenton  </li>\n            <li>Antrim 1844, Taneytown</li>\n            <li>Belmont Country Club, Ashburn  </li>\n            <li>Bethesda Marriott, Bethesda  </li>\n            <li>Bethesda Marriott Suites, Bethesda </li>\n            <li>Bethesda North Marriott Conference Center, Bethesda  </li>\n            <li>Bluemont Vineyard, Bluemont</li>\n            <li>Boar&#x27;s Head Inn, Charlottesville  </li>\n            <li>Bolger Center Hotel, Potomac</li>\n            <li>Bowling Green Country Club, Front Royal </li>\n            <li>Briar Patch Bed &amp;
